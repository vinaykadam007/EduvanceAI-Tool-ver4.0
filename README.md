### Installation:
Clone this repository to your local machine using:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/vinaykadam007/EduvanceAI-Tool-ver4.0.git

1. Open the solution file in Visual Studio.
2. Restore NuGet packages if prompted.
3. Build the solution to generate the executable file.

### Usage:
After building the solution, run the executable to launch the EduvanceAI Tool. The tool's main window will provide an interface to choose between the three categories: Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced.

#### Basic:
The Basic category offers a fully graphical user interface, allowing users to interact with the machine learning algorithms without the need for any coding. Simply load your dataset, choose the algorithm, set the parameters, and visualize the results.

#### Intermediate:
The Intermediate category bridges the gap between GUI interaction and coding. Predefined functions are available, which users can customize using minimal coding. This category is ideal for users looking to experiment with more advanced configurations.

#### Advanced:
The Advanced category is for users who are proficient in coding and machine learning. This category provides a code-centric environment, allowing full flexibility in algorithm customization and implementation. Here, you can unleash the power of your coding skills and experiment extensively.


*** Installation Steps for executable file ***

    If you received this version of EduvanceAI Tool in a EXE file
    (for example, EduvanceAI Tool.exe), you can install it as follows:

    Step 1: Double click on .exe file
    Step 2: It will start with python-3.6.7 installation
    Step 3: While installing, click on "Add to path installation" and click on Install
    Step 4: Once python is installed, it will automatically start installing the tool 
    Step 5: During installation of tool, it will ask for path to store (keep as it is) and click on NEXT button
    Step 6: Finally the installation will be over and you can start over the Tool, by double clicking on the shortcut created on your Desktop
    Step 7: It will automatically install all the libraries, But if you want to install libraries by your own you can open your command prompt and type ("pip install python-docx==0.8.10 comtypes numpy matplotlib pandas sklearn seaborn tensorflow==2.0 keras pillow==7.1.0 opencv-python==4.2.0.34")
    Step 8: Then Enter the serial key provided to you and then you are good to go with the Tool
